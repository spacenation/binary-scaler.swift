# Binary type scaler for Swift

This SPM package provides custom `%`  prefix operator to scale binary integers proportionality between integer types.

- Works with UInt8, Unt16, UInt32, UInt64
- Works with Float and Double
- Fast conversion with binary shifting
- Scaling up and down

## Unsigned Integers
```swift
let result: UInt16 = %UInt8(255)
/// Result is 65535

let result: UInt16 = %UInt8(128)
/// Result is 32896
```

## Floating Points
```swift
let result: UInt8 = %0.5
/// Result is 127

let result: UInt16 = %1.0
/// Result is 65535
/// Operator is using UnitInterval (0.0...1.0) as base range for scaling.
```
